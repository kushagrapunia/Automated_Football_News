# Automated_Football_News
This is something I made for the purpose of learning basics of Automation using Python. 
It is an easy .exe file which basically gives Football news from thesun.co.uk/football website in the form of .csv file containing titles, subtitles and links for the respective news.
I made this using Python language with help of few Python libraries.
I learned about Libraries like Selenium and ChromeDriver.
I made this small program in guidance of www.freecodecamp.org.
