# Automated_Football_News
This is something I made for the purpose of learning basics of web scraping and Automation using Python. 
It is an easy .py file which basically gives Football news from thesun.co.uk/football website in the form of .csv file containing titles, subtitles and links for the respective news.
I learned about Libraries like Selenium and ChromeDriver.

You just have to convert the python script into .exe file :)
